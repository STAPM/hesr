#' Fill in missing costs \lifecycle{maturing}
#'
#' There will be missing unit costs where there have been zero records for a particular combination of variables.
#' If there are no admissions within a subgroup, we expand the age groups until there are enough admissions within a subgroup. If there are so few admissions
#' across all age groups, we can either: average across the condition, and allocate the same cost to everybody with that condition, or remove the condition
#' from the analysis. For example, for alcohol induced pseudo cushings syndrome, there was only 1 admission and therefore this is not enough to reliably
#' estimate a unit cost, and this condition should be removed from the analysis.
#' For now, We have removed the conditions that cannot be reliably costed by sex and IMD, We are currently in the process of updating this
#' to average across the condition (07/08/2019). This function is not finished yet.
#'
#'
#' @param hes is the hes data after it has been ran through hes_cost.R
#'
#' @param missing_cost_lookup is a lookup table to reallocate age category sizes, e.g. from 16-17 to 16-24.
#'
#' @return Returns a summary table of the unit admission costs by condition, age category, sex, and IMD quintile.
