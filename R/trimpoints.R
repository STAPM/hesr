#' Format and clean Trimpoints
#'
#' We use the Trimpoints provided by NHS Digital
#' Trimpoints are used to define a threshold: bed days occurring within the trimpoint (truncated bed days), and bed days occurring above the trimpoint (excess bed days)
#' are reported, costed and priced separately.
#'
#' Trimpoints are calculated from episodes in the HES APC extract for a previoud financial year (the trimpoints used for 2017/18 are those derived from length of stay
#' in 2016/17 activity)
